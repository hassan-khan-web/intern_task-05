In this task, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand my dataset better using Python tools like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. First, I used .info(), .describe(), and .value_counts() to check the basic details, data types, and value counts. Then, I created various plots — histograms to see data distribution, boxplots to check for outliers, scatterplots to find relationships between two variables, a pairplot for all pairwise combinations, and a heatmap to see correlation between numerical columns.

After each plot, I wrote short observations to explain what I found — like patterns, trends, or outliers. Finally, I added a simple summary highlighting key insights, relationships, and patterns in the data. This helped me learn how to find useful information, spot issues, and understand my data better before any further analysis or modeling.

for referance I used Google, ChatGPT, Deepseek, YouTube.
for Tools I used ChatGPT, Deepseek, Jupjter Notebook, Anaconda Navigator, MS Word.
